# AI-Driven-Solution-for-web-scraping-NLP-Community-Calendar-Integration
Here is a Python script that implements an AI-driven solution for web scraping, NLP processing, and integration with a community calendar. It uses tools like BeautifulSoup for scraping, spaCy for NLP, and a mock API for integrating with the calendar.

Steps to Run the Script:

    Install Required Libraries:

pip install requests beautifulsoup4 spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

Replace Placeholders:

    Replace https://example.com/events with the actual URL of the webpage to scrape.
    Replace https://api.example.com/calendar/events with the actual API endpoint for the community calendar.

Run the Script:

    python community_calendar_ai.py

Explanation of Key Features:

    Web Scraping:
        The scrape_data function uses requests and BeautifulSoup to extract event details like title, date, and description.

    Natural Language Processing (NLP):
        The process_event function uses spaCy to extract entities like location (GPE), date, and time from the event description.

    Calendar Integration:
        The integrate_with_calendar function sends processed event data to a community calendar API.

Additional Notes:

    Dynamic Scraping: If the target website uses JavaScript to render content, consider using a tool like Selenium or playwright for scraping.
    Error Handling: The script includes basic error handling. Consider adding more robust logging for better debugging in production.
    API Security: Use secure methods to authenticate API requests, such as API keys or OAuth tokens.

This script is a starting point and can be extended based on your specific requirements, such as more advanced NLP models or integrations.
